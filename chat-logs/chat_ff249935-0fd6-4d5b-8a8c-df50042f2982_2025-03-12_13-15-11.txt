He recounted seeing some U.S. visitors recently stopping to take pictures with the flag.\n\n“Everybody appreciated it,” he said.\n\n![Image 5: Here is a caption for the image:A blue building with a sign that says Ivanhoe Pub and a Canadian flag that says Never 51](https://www.ctvnews.ca/resizer/v2/ST4SG5BBONCVFF6B6MFJP7KQK4.jpeg?auth=1eb4b7795b9ce7e08c2221bc9481ea9787baddd335b1ced9d6236631f193a073&width=800&height=450)\n\nIvanhoe Flag A flag reading \"Never 51\" hung outside the Ivanhoe Pub for weeks before it was vandalized.\n\nIn response to the vandalism, the owner said he plans to have the same message painted onto the brick walls of the establishment, so that “nobody can take it out.”\n\nWhile the flag was mostly a lighthearted gesture, Nabahat said he hopes his fellow Canadians take Trump’s words seriously and make their opposition heard.\n\n“I think our fellow citizens, they are in a sleepy mood, and they should get up,” he said. “Show their protest against what’s happening towards Canada. We need to get united, we can’t just sit back and look at what’s happening to us.”\n\nStewart Prest, a political science professor at UBC, says he isn’t surprised by the act, given the rising tensions between the two countries.\n\n“These fault lines are quite deep and the feelings being exposed are quite raw, because it speaks to fundamental issues of identity and belonging,” he said.\n\n“The danger here is that we can see escalatory spirals where people will interpret that kind of pushback as being newly antagonistic, and we can see those tempers ramping up even further.”\n\nHe adds that it speaks to the strong patriotism among Canadians and the strong resistance against “being told what to do in their own country.”\n\n“They value their ability to express their views”, he said.\n\n_With files from Yasmin Gandham._\n\n[__Report an Error](mailto:vancouverdigitalnews@bellmedia.ca?subject=%E2%80%98Never%2051%E2%80%99%20flag%20at%20Vancouver%20pub%20vandalized,%20owner%20says)\n\n[__Editorial standards & policies](https://www.ctvnews.ca/about-us/editorial-standards-and-policies)\n\n[__Why you can trust CTV News](https://www.ctvnews.ca/about-us/editorial-standards-and-policies/#trust-and-ctv-news)\n\n[![Image 6](https://cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/bellmediainc/6FJBWJVBHZFUTD3HMUSWMJ6FPY.jpg)](https://www.ctvnews.ca/app/?cid=proudlycanadian)\n\n[![Image 7](https://cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/bellmediainc/CEGI7MW2IFAOVCRPX46SKRWCPE.jpg)](https://www.ctvnews.ca/newsletters/)\n\n[Top Stories -----------](https://www.ctvnews.ca/homepage/)\n\n[![Image 8](https://www.ctvnews.ca/resizer/v2/MEPVXRP4URNSXSAJKUNZF36224.jpg?smart=true&auth=6a0aec8a758b2995d5e7b7a2058a39004e435bb9dc231a4ce5b464505739ee73&width=274&height=154)](https://www.ctvnews.ca/vancouver/article/canada-linked-team-finds-saturn-has-128-more-moons-leaving-jupiter-in-cosmic-dust/)\n\n### [Canada-linked team finds Saturn has 128 more moons, leaving Jupiter in cosmic dust](https://www.ctvnews.ca/vancouver/article/canada-linked-team-finds-saturn-has-128-more-moons-leaving-jupiter-in-cosmic-dust/)\n\nMarch 12, 2025 at 3:53PM EDT\n\n[![Image 9](https://www.ctvnews.ca/resizer/v2/DW4CTER2DOP6DW5YP76XUWRUKY.jpg?smart=true&auth=331e323ad03d05a5314f23b21bad1ea3bf09cfed9d69b172f9e9a60ad52ab9c7&width=274&height=154)](https://www.ctvnews.ca/vancouver/article/womans-2022-death-in-lytton-bc-now-treated-as-homicide-police-say/)\n\n### [Woman’s 2022 death in Lytton, B.C., now treated as homicide, police say](https://www.ctvnews.ca/vancouver/article/womans-2022-death-in-lytton-bc-now-treated-as-homicide-police-say/)\n\nMarch 12, 2025 at 2:30PM EDT\n\n[![Image 10](https://www.ctvnews.ca/resizer/v2/BMV2QVQOVFCWXHSX4IAO7U6TPA.jpg?smart=true&auth=0f5534fccbd706d9f290096b6e53102543ee569de00093f789e79688c15c913b&width=274&height=154)](https://www.ctvnews.ca/vancouver/article/ottawa-province-to-provide-rent-support-for-bc-gender-based-violence-survivors/)\n\n### [Ottawa, province to provide rent support for B.C. gender-based violence survivors](https://www.ctvnews.ca/vancouver/article/ottawa-province-to-provide-rent-suppo",

[Sign up for our free newsletter](http://newsletter.straight.com/subscribe/?utm_source=straight&utm_medium=article).\n\nGiven the chance to interview any historical figure, Ziwe doesn’t hesitate: George Washington. And her first question would be devastatingly simple: “Is this what you dreamed of?” It’s a pointed inquiry that perfectly captures her signature style, using irony to reveal deeper truths about power and politics. Political figures are no strangers to her hot seat—her [viral interview with George Santos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbkafIMdl8), for instance, offers an unfiltered glimpse into the absurdity of modern governance.\n\nZiwe has built a career making people squirm—in the best way possible. Known for her fearless interviews that expose contradictions in real time, the comedian, writer, and actress has mastered the art of satire as a tool for dissecting power, privilege, and identity. Ahead of her highly anticipated appearance at [UBC’s Phil Lind Initiative](https://chancentre.com/events/the-phil-lind-initiative-ziwe/), presented by the School of Public Policy and Global Affairs, she sat down with the _Straight_ to talk about comedy, identity, and her excitement about finally visiting Vancouver.\n\nDespite her reputation for satirical takedowns, Ziwe is quick to stress that comedy isn’t a substitute for activism. “I think activists are so essential to moving and shaping and keeping democracy alive,” she says. “Satire is merely one lane in a nine-lane highway of contributing to discourse around really important issues.” Still, her work undeniably fuels public conversation, making social critique more accessible, if not unavoidable.\n\nHaving built her career questioning privilege, Ziwe understands the challenges of navigating identity within powerful institutions, which resonates deeply with UBC's diverse student body. “Having an understanding of what your identity is and what that means to you is, to me, the most important thing that I took from my experience in school,” she shares. “Having a stronger sense of self was really essential.” She encourages students to cultivate this perspective, especially in industries where power dynamics rarely favour the underrepresented.\n\nIf she were to teach a class at UBC tomorrow, she knows what would be in the syllabus. “It would be called ‘The Power of Perspective’ or 'POP,'” she says. “What’s really interesting about my work, and about the different guests I interview, is that they have very strong perspectives that they’re not afraid to double down on. Perspective, specifically as an artist, is essential to having anything to say in the first place.” Her course would focus on developing a distinct point of view and integrating it into creative work—something she’s clearly mastered.\n\nWhen asked to share her most controversial yet correct opinion, Ziwe doesn’t hold back. “I love it when someone gets in trouble for doing something problematic. I love to go to the Instagram comments of their posts and see people be mean to them. It just gives me so much joy,” she admits. “There’s nothing that makes me happier than when someone is racist and then they lose their job. I bask in that.” But despite the guilty pleasure, she also believes online backlash can go too far. “I actually think that it should be illegal to virtually harass people, because sometimes the public gets it wrong,” she says. “It makes the world wide web a really unpleasant place.”\n\nAnd for those craving more Ziwe content, she has plenty in the works. “I just dropped an interview with [Roy Wood Jr. and Rosebud Baker](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pcKhPmcaWS4), and I’m shooting another one on Sunday,” she shares. “I’m trying to do more.”\n\nAs for what she’s most excited about in Vancouver? _Twilight_. “I’ve never been before! I want to see where they shot _Twilight_,” she says. When told that _Fifty Shades of Grey_ was also filmed here, she replies, “Oh, really? So, something to keep in mind.” While her itinerary isn’t locked in, she has one request for locals: “Tell your readers that I’m excited about _Twilight_.”\n\n_[Click here to report a typo.](https://www.straight.com/report-a-typo?nid=1454824)_\n\n![Image 3](https://www.straight.com/arts/ziwe-on-satire-identity-and-why-shes-excited-to-visit-vancouver)\n\n#### Vicki Duong\n\nVicki Duong is a writer and a self-proclaimed girl-about-town, always down for a local comedy show or an iced matcha latte.\n\n[Go to profile](https://www.straight.com/users/vicki-duong)\n\nJoin the discussion\n\nComments\n--------\n\nFacebook comments not loading?

Now, I'll summarize both articles in one paragraph:

In a display of Canadian patriotism and resistance, the Ivanhoe Pub in East Vancouver had its "Never 51" flag vandalized after hanging for weeks in protest of U.S. President Donald Trump's suggestion that Canada should become the 51st state, with the owner Nasser Nabahat planning to paint the message on the pub's brick walls to ensure its visibility. Meanwhile, in a separate story, comedian and satirist Ziwe is set to visit Vancouver for a UBC event, discussing her approach to comedy as a tool for social critique, sharing her perspectives on identity, activism, and her unique interviewing style that exposes contradictions in power structures, while humorously expressing her excitement about potentially visiting filming locations from "Twilight" during her trip.
